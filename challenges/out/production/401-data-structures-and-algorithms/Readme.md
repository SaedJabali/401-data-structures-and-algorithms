# Stacks and Queues

Stacks and queues are linear data structure but each one has its own rules and methods.

*Stack* follows the rule **LIFO** which means last in first out 
where *queue* is the opposite, it follows the rule **FIFO** which means first in first out.

Stack methods:
* push to add element to the stack.
* pop to delete element from the stack.
* peek to get the value of the head/top.

Queue methods:
* enqueue to add element to the queue.
* dequeue to delete element from the queue.
* peek to get the value of the front.

## Challenge 

in this challenge we are supposed to do manipulation on stack and on a queue,
we should add and delete elements and so on.
